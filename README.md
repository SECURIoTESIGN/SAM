# Project Overview

Security Advising Modules (SAM) is a framework that aggregates and connects the various modules developed under the scope of the [SECURIoTESIGN](https://lx.it.pt/securIoTesign/) project while providing a graphical interface to interact with them. SAM is modular, allowing for both quick integrations of newly developed modules and updates to existing modules. SAM works as a personal security assistant, more relatable, and capable of communicating with the end-user through a series of easily understandable questions, which the user can answer directly or through a set of predefined answers.

SAM's graphical user interface or frontend is available on this repository, while the backend is available [here](https://github.com/SECURIoTESIGN/SAM-API/).

# Installation

1) Deploy SAM's Web API, more information can be found [here](https://github.com/SECURIoTESIGN/SAM-API). 
3) From inside the ```SAM``` directory install ```package.json``` dependencies as follows: 
```
cd SAM
npm install
```
4) Now you are ready to go! :smile: To start SAM's Web user interface:
```
$ npm start
```
